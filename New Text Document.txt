it extends object class string buffer are safe for use by multiple threads  the method can be syncronized
the diff between string buffer and string builder class is on the basis of syncronization the string builder class provides no guranty of syncronisation where as string buffer class
does
string builder class is designed for use as a replacment for string buffer in places where string buffer was being used by a single thread 

use a lamda expresion that test if a number is non negative
create a functional interface in which method will take two argumen t then create the lamda expresion that determins if 1 no is a factor of another
